You are an expert at organizing notes into logical folders based on their content and themes.

Analyze the following unorganized notes and suggest folders to organize them into. You should:
1. Identify common themes, topics, or categories across the notes
2. Create folder names that are clear, concise, and descriptive
3. Assign each note to one or more appropriate folders (notes can belong to multiple folders)
4. Suggest new folder names if existing folders don't fit well

Unorganized Notes:
{notes}

Existing Folders:
{existing_folders}

Return your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "suggested_folders": [
    {{"name": "Folder Name", "color": "#colorcode or null"}}
  ],
  "note_assignments": [
    {{"note_id": "note-id", "folder_names": ["Folder Name 1", "Folder Name 2"]}}
  ]
}}

Guidelines:
- Folder names should be 1-3 words, capitalized (e.g., "Work Projects", "Personal Goals")
- You can reuse existing folders or suggest new ones
- Each note should be assigned to at least one folder
- Suggest colors for new folders (use common hex codes like #87ae73 for green, #5BB9C2 for blue)
- Keep the response complete - don't truncate or summarize

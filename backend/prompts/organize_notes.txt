You are organizing a collection of notes into folders. Your task is to:
1. Analyze the notes and group similar ones together
2. Suggest folder names that are clear, concise, and meaningful
3. Use existing folders when appropriate, or suggest new ones
4. Assign each note to one or more folders (notes can belong to multiple folders)
5. Provide brief reasoning for each assignment

{existing_folders}

Notes to organize:
{notes}

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{{
  "suggested_folders": [
    {{
      "name": "Folder Name",
      "color": "#hexcolor"
    }}
  ],
  "assignments": [
    {{
      "note_id": "note-uuid",
      "folder_names": ["Folder Name 1", "Folder Name 2"],
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this note belongs in these folders"
    }}
  ]
}}

Rules:
- Use existing folders whenever they fit, only suggest new folders when necessary
- Folder names should be 1-3 words, capitalized
- Colors should be pleasant and distinct (use colors like #5BB9C2, #87ae73, #9a4e4e, #FDB813, etc.)
- Each note should be assigned to at least one folder
- Reasoning should be 1-2 sentences max
- Group related topics together (e.g., work projects, personal goals, ideas, reference material, etc.)

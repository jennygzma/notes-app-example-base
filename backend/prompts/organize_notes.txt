You are organizing notes into folders. Analyze the provided notes and create a logical folder structure.

Guidelines:
1. Use existing folders when appropriate - don't create duplicates
2. Create new folders for distinct topics that don't fit existing categories
3. Each note can be assigned to multiple folders if relevant
4. Choose descriptive, concise folder names
5. Suggest colors for new folders (use hex codes like #87ae73, #5BB9C2, #9a4e4e, etc.)

Existing folders:
{existing_folders}

Notes to organize:
{notes}

Return your response as JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "suggested_folders": [
    {{"name": "Folder Name", "color": "#hex"}}
  ],
  "note_assignments": [
    {{"note_id": "note-id-here", "folder_names": ["Folder Name 1", "Folder Name 2"]}}
  ]
}}

Make sure every note in the input has an assignment in note_assignments, even if it's to a single folder.

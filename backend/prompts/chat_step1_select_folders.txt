You are helping find notes to answer a user's question. Your task is to analyze the question and select which folders are most likely to contain relevant notes.

Question: {question}

Available folders:
{folders}

Recent conversation (for context):
{conversation_history}

Analyze the question carefully and determine which folders might contain notes relevant to answering it. Consider:
1. Keywords and topics mentioned in the question
2. The semantic meaning and intent behind the question
3. Previous conversation context if available

Return your response as JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you selected these folders",
  "selected_folder_ids": ["folder-id-1", "folder-id-2", ...]
}}

If no folders seem relevant, return an empty array for selected_folder_ids and explain why in the reasoning.

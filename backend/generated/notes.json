First paper was a success and felt like my work was paying off \n\nMay\n- Continued travelling to Japan with Tao and my sister!!

And hang out w grandparents and bonded w my grandpa abt research \n- Decided to heavily explore and prioritize hobbies like art, vlogging, painting, music in the future \n\nAugust\n- went to Greece to meet Nikos family! I have loved Greece ever since 6th grade and now I feel like I manifested it \n- Came back to nyc and had panic attacks of feeling like I couldn\u2019t rely on anyone\n- Trying to be intentional of what type of friends I want to make and the type of community I want to build\n\nSeptember \n- met friends who matched my energy better and I didn\u2019t feel like I was over exerting myself into forcing square into a circle\n- Started PhD officially and trying to navigate around my advisor lol\n- Put way too much pressure on myself and forgot why I liked research to begin with \n- Began doing a lot more self care as a form of self soothing\n\nOctober \n- Continued to put unnecessary pressure on myself and hold myself to an insane standard work-wise\n- Beat myself up over situations bc of self-doubt\n- Became too codependent because I was so scared \n- Burnt out like crazy\n\nNovember\n- tried to make mental shift again to spend more time alone\n- still doubted myself and my decisions a lot but felt more validated about my gut intuitions (but I shouldn\u2019t have to wait for external validation for me to feel some type of way!)\n- Felt more healthy but still prone to panic attacks and not even realizing something is triggering me \n- Relationship with work was changing for the better again although still in the gutter \n- Many double dates!! Happy to find double date situations \n\nDecember \n- Validated that the situation I was trying to leave was worth leaving and that I need to trust my intuition \n- Tryna fuckin push thru some panic attacks, learning to regulate by waiting until my heart rate comes down to take my thoughts seriously\n- Trying to figure out what\u2019s fair vs not and what i can reasonably expect of myself and others \n- Instinctively operated from a place of scarcity/low self esteem again bc my mental health slides at home lol \n- Went to Taiwan before going back to motherland to hang out w my extended family fam!  \n\nOverall I had to confront of a lot of things with myself this year and shed behavior that was not serving me! Ongoing process :) \n\nnext year I want to manage my anxiety and ocd a lot better and let things go (as a form of taking care of myself) without trying to control the future.  Continuing to be more intentional/practice self care and I start to work through some of my resentments so I can exist with more peace and safety. I want to trust more with people who show me they\u2019ve trust worthy instead of letting the past fuck shit up and build a stronger community and get better at communicating things I dislike ",
